Focused on developing a Movie Recommendation System using cosine similarity techniques in Python, aimed at providing personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and similarities between movies

Utilized advanced pre-processing techniques to prepare the movie dataset for analysis, including merging genre and overview information to create unique movie tags. Employed CountVectorizer to convert textual data into numerical vectors, facilitating cosine similarity calculations

Implemented cosine similarity as the primary Machine Learning algorithm to determine the similarity between movies based on their numerical vectors. This algorithm enabled the system to identify and recommend movies with similar attributes or themes, enhancing user experience and engagement
